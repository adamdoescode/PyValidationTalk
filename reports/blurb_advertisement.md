# pd.read_csv is NOT all you need: DataFrame validation in Python

Many beginner data tradies dream of replacing the chaotic Excel workbooks of their forebears with elegant, reproducible Python workflows. However, real-world datasets rarely adhere to our modest assumptions, leading to frustration over inconsistent formats, unexpected null values, and non-ISO-compliant date columns.
In this short talk, aimed at the emerging data tradie, I will give a brief tour of the tools for *DataFrame validation* in Python: Pola.rs, Pandera, Pydantic, and even the humble `pd.to_datetime()` equip us with the means to tame unruly, manually curated spreadsheets and bring order to the Data Pipelines.
Adam is an air quality data scientist with Environmental Technologies and Analytics. He has no formal training in python but has at least stumbled though a Graduate Diploma in Biostatistics. His credentials for discussing DataFrame validation come from repeated attempts to beat wild Excel workbooks into conformity and handling a diverse cast of "quality controlled" datasets. In a past life he was a research biologist and science communicator. He remains a committed bird nerd and maintains a neobrutalist website at https://adamdoescode.github.io/.
